# DNA-FASTA-2-Protein-FASTA
A basic python program that translates an input DNA sequence in FASTA format to a protien sequence in fasta format
The idea is to import multiple headers and sequences from a text file, 
then convert the DNA sequences to corresponding Amino Acids using a dictionary,
then output the headers and Amino Acid sequences to a new fasta file
